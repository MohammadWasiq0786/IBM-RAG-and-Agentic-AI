      "\n",
      "Sure! A neural network is a type of computer program designed to recognize patterns and make decisions based on data. It’s inspired by the way the human brain works. Here's a simple breakdown of its key components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Neurons**: The basic building blocks of a neural network are called neurons. Just like brain neurons, they receive input, process it, and pass on their output to other neurons.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Layers**: Neurons are organized into layers:\n",
      "   - **Input Layer**: The first layer that receives raw data (features). For example, in a picture recognition task, the input layer could receive pixel values of an image.\n",
      "   - **Hidden Layer(s)**: These layers process the input and are where most of the computation happens. There can be multiple hidden layers, which allow the network to learn complex patterns.\n",
      "   - **Output Layer**: The final layer that provides the result. For instance, in a classification task, it could indicate which category an input belongs to.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Weights and Biases**: Each connection between neurons has a weight, which adjusts as the network learns. A bias helps to shift the output of a neuron, allowing for more flexible learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Activation Function**: After processing the inputs, a neuron applies an activation function to decide if it should \"fire\" (activate) or not. This introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing the network to learn more complex functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Training**: Neural networks learn by adjusting the weights and biases based on examples they see. This is usually done through a method called backpropagation and involves minimizing an error function to improve accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Applications**: Neural networks are used in various tasks, including image and speech recognition, language translation, and game playing, among many others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, a neural network learns from data to make predictions or decisions, much like how our brains interpret information.\n",

      "Sure! Training a neural network involves adjusting its weights and biases so that it makes better predictions. One of the key methods used for this is called **backpropagation**. Here’s a detailed look at the training process, including backpropagation:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step-by-step Training Process\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initialization**: \n",
      "   - At first, the network's weights and biases are typically initialized to small random values.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Forward Propagation**:\n",
      "   - Input data (e.g., images, text) is fed into the input layer.\n",
      "   - Each neuron processes the inputs, applying its weights and biases.\n",
      "   - The activation function is applied to determine the output of neurons in the hidden layers, which are then passed through to the output layer.\n",
      "   - Finally, the network produces an output (for instance, classifying an image) based on its current weights and biases.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Loss Calculation**:\n",
      "   - After getting the output, the next step is to calculate the **loss** (or error) using a loss function. This function measures how far off the network’s predictions are from the actual target values (the true labels).\n",
      "   - Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error for regression tasks and Cross-Entropy Loss for classification tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Backpropagation**:\n",
      "   - This is the main part of the training process where we update the weights to minimize the loss.\n",
      "   - Backpropagation involves two main steps: calculating gradients and updating weights.\n",
      "\n",
      "   1. **Calculate Gradients**:\n",
      "      - The derivative of the loss with respect to each weight is calculated. This tells us how much the loss would change if we changed the weight slightly.\n",
      "      - This is done using the chain rule of calculus to propagate the error backwards through the network, from the output layer to the input layer. It helps find out how much each weight contributed to the error.\n",
      "\n",
      "   2. **Update Weights**:\n",
      "      - Once we have the gradients, we can update the weights and biases in the opposite direction to minimize the loss. This is typically done using an optimization algorithm like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).\n",
      "      - The weight update looks something like this:\n",
      "        \\[\n",
      "        w = w - \\eta \\cdot \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w}\n",
      "        \\]\n",
      "        where:\n",
      "        - \\( w \\) is the weight,\n",
      "        - \\( \\eta \\) is the learning rate (a small value that determines how big a step we take),\n",
      "        - \\( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w} \\) is the gradient of the loss with respect to that weight.\n",
      "  \n",
      "5. **Iteration**:\n",
      "   - Steps 2-4 are repeated for many iterations (epochs) using the training dataset. The network improves gradually as it learns from the errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Validation**: \n",
      "   - After training, the network's performance is evaluated on a separate validation dataset to ensure it can generalize well to new, unseen data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "In summary, training a neural network involves:\n",
      "- Feeding data through the network (forward propagation),\n",
      "- Calculating the error or loss,\n",
      "- Backpropagating the loss to find gradients,\n",
      "- Updating the weights to minimize the loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "By repeating this process over many examples and epochs, the network learns to make more accurate predictions!\n",

      "Final Summary:\n",
      "A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain, comprised of interconnected neurons organized in layers (input, hidden, output). Training a neural network involves forward propagation of data, calculating loss based on the model's predictions, and using backpropagation to adjust weights and biases. Backpropagation calculates gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight and updates them to minimize the error. This iterative process continues over multiple epochs to improve the model's performance on predictions.\n"

    "\n",

      "If you can't install new packages in your current environment, consider using one of these options:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Jupyter Notebook:** It's a great tool for running Python code that often has libraries like `matplotlib` pre-installed. You can create a notebook and run the code there.\n",
      "- **Google Colab:** This is a cloud-based Jupyter-like environment where you can run Python code with many libraries pre-installed, including `matplotlib`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Option 3: Alternative Code without `matplotlib`\n",
      "If you cannot use `matplotlib` at all and just want to visualize sine waves, consider using other available plotting libraries (if installed) or simply output the data to CSV or text format.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example in Google Colab\n",
      "If you're using Google Colab, here’s how you can run the sine wave code above:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).\n",
      "2. Create a new notebook.\n",
      "3. Copy and paste the sine wave plotting code mentioned earlier into a cell.\n",
      "4. Run the cell to generate and save the plot.\n",

    "## Agent Orchestration & Multi-Agent Systems in AG2<a name=\"agent-orchestration\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "AG2 enables the coordination of multiple intelligent agents to collaboratively solve complex tasks. This is known as **agent orchestration** — a powerful design pattern where each agent plays a specialized role, and a **group manager** handles the conversation flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Multi-Agent Systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real-world problems require more than just a single AI assistant. With AG2, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assign specific roles and responsibilities to different agents.\n",
    "- Orchestrate conversations using built-in patterns (for example, Auto, RoundRobin, Manual).\n",
    "- Enable agents to build on each other's outputs and refine ideas.\n",
    "- Incorporate human agents for oversight, decisions, or approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orchestration Patterns in AG2\n",
    "\n",
    "AG2 provides several orchestration patterns to structure agent interactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two-Agent Chat**: Simple back-and-forth between two agents.\n",
    "- **Sequential Chat**: Conversations where one agent’s output becomes another’s input.\n",
    "- **Group Chat**: Multiple agents interact, with selection logic for who speaks next.\n",
    "- **Nested Chat**: Reusable sub-conversations packaged as a single workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## GroupChat and GroupChatManager\n",
    "\n",
    "In AG2, multi-agent collaboration is coordinated using `GroupChat` and `GroupChatManager`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GroupChat\n",
    "\n",
    "`GroupChat` defines a team of agents and how they interact in a shared conversation. It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agents**: A list of AI (or human) agents that participate in the group dialogue.\n",
    "- **Speaker Selection Method**: Determines which agent speaks next. Options include:\n",
    "  - `\"auto\"`: Uses the LLM to select the most contextually appropriate agent.\n",
    "  - `\"round_robin\"`: Agents take turns in a fixed sequence.\n",
    "  - `\"manual\"`: Human selects the next speaker.\n",
    "  - `\"random\"`: Agents are chosen randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure allows you to define collaborative workflows where agents build on each other’s contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GroupChatManager\n",
    "\n",
    "`GroupChatManager` is responsible for managing the flow of the group conversation and it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Orchestrates message passing between agents.\n",
    "- Decides when to stop the conversation (for example, based on a termination condition or turn limit).\n",
    "- Leverages the speaker selection method defined in `GroupChat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It acts like a facilitator that ensures the conversation runs according to the logic you've configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A conversation is initiated by one of the agents (often a user or teacher agent).\n",
    "2. The `GroupChatManager` uses the selected pattern (for example, AutoPattern) to determine which agent speaks next.\n",
    "3. Agents take turns responding based on their roles and system messages.\n",
    "4. The conversation ends either when a stop condition (for example, a message like \"DONE\") is met or when a maximum number of turns is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup enables modular, role-based collaboration — ideal for use cases like lesson planning, research workflows, or multi-perspective decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore more orchestration patterns, visit the AG2 documentation at:  \n",
    "https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/orchestration/group-chat/introduction/\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Group Chat for Lesson Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how a teacher agent collaborates with a planner and a reviewer to create a lesson plan, using AG2’s `GroupChat` and `AutoPattern` to manage the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The `is_termination_msg` parameter used for `teacher` agent defines a custom rule to end the conversation —  \n",
    "in this case, the workflow stops when the teacher replies with \"DONE!\".\n"

    "### What is `register_function(...)` ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In AG2, `register_function(...)` is used to expose a Python function as a **tool** that can be executed by one agent on behalf of another. This enables agents to delegate tasks like computation, data processing, or external API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose\n",
    "- Extend agent capabilities beyond text generation.\n",
    "- Allow agents to solve tasks through **function execution**.\n",
    "- Enable collaborative workflows between a **caller** and an **executor** agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",
    "- **function**: A regular Python function to be used as a tool.\n",
    "- **caller**: The agent that will request the tool to be used.\n",
    "- **executor**: The agent that will actually execute the function.\n",
    "- **description** *(optional)*: A natural language description of the function for the LLM to decide when to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "register_function(\n",
    "    is_prime,\n",
    "    caller=math_asker,\n",
    "    executor=math_checker,\n",

    "\n",
    "Structured outputs ensure consistent, validated agent responses using Pydantic models.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This is crucial for:\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Data validation**: Ensuring response format consistency\n",
    "- **API integration**: Reliable data exchange\n",
    "- **Quality assurance**: Preventing malformed outputs\n",
    "- **Type safety**: Clear data contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Like standardized hospital forms ensure doctors always record patient info the same way, structured outputs make sure agents respond in predictable, machine-readable formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In AG2, structured outputs are implemented using Pydantic models and the `response_format` parameter in the `LLMConfig`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that your agent always returns outputs in a consistent structure, you define a Pydantic class (for example, `ResponseModel`) and assign it to the `response_format` argument of your configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells the underlying LLM to return a JSON-compatible response matching the defined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ResponseModel(BaseModel):\n",
    "    name: str\n",
    "    status: str\n",
    "\n",
    "llm_config = LLMConfig(\n",

    "    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n",
    "    response_format=ResponseModel\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent automatically formats its responses to match the ResponseModel. \n",
    "- You don’t need to prompt the LLM to format its response.\n",
    "- The response is parsed and validated by AG2.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Configuration and security\n",
    "- **Never hardcode API keys** - use environment variables\n",
    "- **Use config lists** for production systems with fallback models\n",
    "- **Set appropriate temperature** values (0.0 for deterministic, 0.7-1.0 for creative)\n",
    "- **Implement rate limiting** and error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent design\n",
    "- **Write clear system messages** that define role, capabilities, and constraints\n",
    "- **Set max_consecutive_auto_reply** to prevent infinite loops\n",
    "- **Choose appropriate human_input_mode** based on use case\n",
    "- **Specialize agents** for specific tasks rather than creating generalists\n",
    "\n",
    "### HITL implementation\n",
    "- **Use HITL for high-stakes decisions** requiring human judgment\n",
    "- **Implement clear escalation criteria** (amount thresholds, risk levels)\n",
    "- **Provide context** to human supervisors for informed decisions\n",
    "- **Log all human interventions** for audit trails\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-agent orchestration\n",
    "- **Design clear workflows** with defined handoffs between agents\n",
    "- **Use GroupChat** for collaborative problem-solving\n",
    "- **Implement termination conditions** to prevent endless conversations\n",
    "- **Monitor conversation quality** and intervention points\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools and integration\n",
    "- **Create focused tools** for specific capabilities\n",
    "- **Implement proper error handling** in tool functions\n",
    "- **Validate tool inputs** and outputs\n",
    "- **Document tool capabilities** clearly for agents\n",
    "\n",
