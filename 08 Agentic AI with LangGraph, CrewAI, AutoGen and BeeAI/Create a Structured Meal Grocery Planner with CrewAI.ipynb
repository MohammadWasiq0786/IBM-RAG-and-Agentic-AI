    "You are an individual who loves cooking delicious meals but struggles with the overwhelming decisions around meal planning, budgeting, and grocery shopping. In the past, this involved hours of manual work – browsing endless recipes, calculating ingredient quantities, checking prices, organizing shopping lists, and hoping everything fits your budget and dietary needs. By leveraging AI agents through CrewAI, you can dramatically accelerate this process while ensuring you get exactly what you need for a perfect meal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement an end-to-end meal planning and grocery shopping system using AI agents. You'll create:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured data models** using Pydantic to ensure consistent grocery lists and meal plans.\n",
    "- **Specialized AI agents** for recipe research, shopping organization, and budget optimization.\n",
    "- **A coordinated workflow** that transforms a simple meal craving into a complete, budget-conscious shopping strategy.\n",
    "- **A reusable YAML configuration** that allows you to define agents, tasks, and crew behavior declaratively, making the system easier to maintain and scale.\n",
    "- **A class-based CrewBase setup** that combines structured Python code with external YAML files, enabling hooks for pre-processing inputs and post-processing outputs, and automating the agent-task pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, you'll have a reusable framework that can generate comprehensive, organized shopping plans for any meal within minutes rather than hours — all with just a few lines of configuration and code.\n"

    "## Creating the Grocery Shopping Assistant Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "To create our grocery shopping assistant, we are going to begin by creating the blueprints (a.k.a. classes) to manage the structure. Why? Because when you're dealing with grocery lists, meal plans, and shopping data, you need everything organized in a predictable format. Without structure, you might get a shopping list that says \"some chicken\" instead of \"2 lbs chicken breast\" - not very helpful when you're at the store!\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, we are going to use **Pydantic**, which acts like a strict organizer for our data. Think of it as creating templates that ensure every grocery item has exactly what we need: a name, quantity, price, and store section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Are We Creating These Classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are creating these classes to **organize and structure grocery shopping data** in a clear and practical way. Instead of handling messy, unstructured text such as \"get some chicken and vegetables,\" we break down shopping into smaller, structured parts that our AI agents can work with reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pydantic's `BaseModel` helps structure and validate our grocery data easily. For example, if we define a `GroceryItem` model with `name: str` and `estimated_price: str`, it ensures that every grocery item must have both a name and a price estimate. `Field` adds extra rules and descriptions, like explaining that `quantity` should be formatted as \"2 lbs\" or \"1 gallon\". `List` from `typing` allows complex data structures, like a `ShoppingCategory` model storing `items: List[GroceryItem]` - a produce section containing multiple vegetables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes handling grocery data simple and reliable, ensuring that when our AI agent says \"buy chicken,\" it specifically means \"buy 2 lbs of chicken breast for $8-12 from the meat section.\" ([Pydantic Docs](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/))\n"

    "**Key Features of Our Shopping Organizer:**\n",

    "- **Quantity Calculation**: Ensures proper amounts for the specified number of servings\n",

    "\n",
    "####  What is YAML?\n",
    "\n",
    "**YAML** (YAML Ain’t Markup Language) is a lightweight, human-readable format for structuring data. It is widely used in configuration files because it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is easy to read and write.\n",
    "- Supports nested data structures (for example, lists, dictionaries).\n",
    "- Keeps logic separate from code, ideal for configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Why Use YAML with CrewAI?\n",
    "\n",
    "CrewAI supports YAML-based configuration for defining:\n",
    "- Agents\n",
    "- Tasks\n",
    "- Crew processes\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to:\n",
    "- Quickly iterate on agent/task logic without modifying Python code.\n",
    "- Enable team collaboration (even with non-developers).\n",
    "- Prepare workflows for production deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Can You Define in YAML?\n",
    "\n",
    "In YAML you can define te following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agents**: Roles, goals, backstories, tools, verbosity, and more\n",
    "- **Tasks**: Task descriptions, expected outputs, assigned agents, and dependencies\n",
    "- **Crew**: The execution flow (for example, `sequential`, `hierarchical`)\n",

    "#### What is `@CrewBase`?\n",
    "In CrewAI, `@CrewBase` is a Python class decorator that automates the collection and wiring of your agents and tasks — especially when you're organizing your crew logic in Python, YAML or hybrid config (YAML + code). Basically, when we have the following:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "@CrewBase\n",
    "class myCrew:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "It tells CrewAI that: This class defines the agents, tasks, and crew I want to run. Please find them automatically and wire everything together.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think that we already defined separate Agent, Task and Crew why do we need CrewBase? We need it because this can get repetitive and hard to manage as your app grows. That’s where `@CrewBase` shines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use `@CrewBase` + decorators?\n",
    "- **Auto-discovers** methods decorated with @agent, @task, and @crew inside the class\n",
    "- **Loads config** automatically from YAML (if present)\n",
    "- Keeps everything **modular**, **scalable**, and **clean** for production setups\n",

    "### How `@CrewBase` Works with YAML in This Project\n",
    "\n",
    "CrewAI's `@CrewBase` decorator works seamlessly with YAML files, pure Python, or a hybrid setup — and in our case, we're using the hybrid approach to demonstrate how it all comes together.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what's happening here is:\n",
    "- The `@agent` method is loading the agent config from the YAML file via: `self.agents_config[\"leftover_manager\"]` and returns an Agent object.\n",
    "- Similarly, the `@task` method does: `self.tasks_config[\"leftover_task\"]` and returns a Task object, linked to the `leftover_manager`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Jupyter notebook, we import the `LeftoverCrew` class which allows us to access the Agent and Task objects that were dynamically constructed using YAML-based config.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why YAML Location Matters?\n",
    "The `@CrewBase` class (under the hood) looks for default YAML files under a `config/` directory. That’s why we needed to place our `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` inside a `config/` folder — otherwise CrewAI wouldn’t find them automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why We Needed a .py File?\n",
    "The @CrewBase class and its decorators such as `@agent`, `@task`, and `@crew` do not work in Jupyter notebooks due to how the CrewAI framework relies on Python’s inspection tools. What it means is CrewAI uses Python’s `inspect` module to find the file path of the class:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Path(inspect.getfile(cls)).parent\n",
    "```\n",
    "This works fine when the class is defined in a regular `.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "- Classes are defined in cells, not .py files.\n",
    "- `inspect.getfile(cls)` fails because there is no real source file.\n",
    "- As a result, CrewAI cannot determine the base directory, and throws an error.\n",
