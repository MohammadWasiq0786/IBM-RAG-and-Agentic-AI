Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways classically described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according to deterministic rules. Any classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a (classical) mechanical device such as a Turing machine, with only polynomial overhead in time. Quantum computers, on the other hand are believed to require exponentially more resources to simulate classically. It is widely believed that a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. Theoretically, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations. However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two \"basis\" states, a state that is in an abstract sense \"between\" the two basis states. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly.\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).  Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain quantum devices can outperform classical computers on narrowly defined tasks, a milestone referred to as quantum advantage or quantum supremacy. These tasks are not necessarily useful for real-world applications.", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing"}]

## Cybersecurity Risks of Quantum Computing for Financial Institutions

### Main Threats
1. **Cryptography Compromise**: Quantum computers can potentially break certain public-key cryptographic algorithms (e.g., RSA, ECC) by factoring large numbers exponentially faster than classical computers. This could compromise the security of financial transactions and data.
2. **Key Exchange and Digital Signatures**: Quantum computers can break certain key exchange protocols and digital signature schemes, undermining the integrity and authenticity of financial communications.

### Timeline for Concern
- **Short-term (5-10 years)**: Expect significant advancements in quantum computing, but large-scale, practical quantum computers are still in development.
- **Mid-term (10-20 years)**: As quantum technology matures, the risk to current cryptographic systems will increase. Financial institutions should begin preparing for a post-quantum cryptography world.

### Recommended Preparation Strategies
1. **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Transition to cryptographic algorithms and protocols resistant to quantum attacks, such as:
   - Lattice-based cryptography
   - Code-based cryptography
   - Hash-based signatures
   - Multivariate cryptography
2. **Hybrid Solutions**: Implement hybrid cryptographic solutions that combine classical and quantum-resistant algorithms to ensure security against both classical and quantum threats.
3. **Monitoring and Adaptation**: Continuously monitor advancements in quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography. Be prepared to adapt security measures as new standards and technologies emerge.
4. **Collaboration and Standards**: Engage with industry consortia, regulatory bodies, and standards organizations to stay informed about best practices and evolving standards for quantum-safe cryptography.
5. **Inventory and Assessment**: Conduct an inventory of cryptographic assets and assess their vulnerability to quantum attacks. Prioritize the migration of critical systems to quantum-resistant cryptography.

By understanding the risks and proactively preparing for the advent of quantum computing, financial institutions can mitigate potential cybersecurity threats and ensure the long-term security of their operations.
