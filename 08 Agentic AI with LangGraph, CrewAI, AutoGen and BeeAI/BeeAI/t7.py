Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways classically described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according to deterministic rules. Any classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a (classical) mechanical device such as a Turing machine, with only polynomial overhead in time. Quantum computers, on the other hand are believed to require exponentially more resources to simulate classically. It is widely believed that a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. Theoretically, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations. However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two \"basis\" states, a state that is in an abstract sense \"between\" the two basis states. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly.\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).  Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain quantum devices can outperform classical computers on narrowly defined tasks, a milestone referred to as quantum advantage or quantum supremacy. These tasks are not necessarily useful for real-world applications.", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing"}]

2. **Key Exchange and Digital Signatures**: Quantum computers can also break certain key exchange and digital signature schemes, potentially allowing attackers to intercept and alter sensitive information.

### Timeline for Concern
The timeline for concern is generally considered to be within the next 5-10 years, as significant advancements are being made in quantum computing hardware. It is expected that a large-scale quantum computer will be capable of breaking RSA-2048 by 2030.

### Recommended Preparation Strategies
1. **Implement Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Algorithms**: Financial institutions should consider implementing quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, such as lattice-based cryptography, hash-based signatures, and code-based cryptography.
2. **Develop a Migration Plan**: Develop a migration plan for existing cryptographic systems to quantum-resistant cryptography.
3. **Monitor Quantum Computing Advancements**: Continuously monitor advancements in quantum computing and assess the potential risks to their cryptographic systems.
4. **Diversify Cryptographic Algorithms**: Consider diversifying cryptographic algorithms to reduce dependence on a single algorithm or type of algorithm.
